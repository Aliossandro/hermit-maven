- Matthew added a new version of the OWLReasoner interface to the OWL
API and we do not yet implement it (we have to talk with Matthew about 
non-implementable methods and get them removed) 
task assigned to: Giorgos

- Protege is a bit behind, but the Protege reasoner interface will
most likely also change soon to reflect the new OWLReasoner interface
changes. 
task assigned to: wait until we know more

- We need to check acyclicity of datatype definitions.
task assigned to:  Rob

- The OWL WG test harness is currently extended to work with both the
old and the new OWL API. Until that is done, HermiT can not be used
with the test harness and once that is completed, we have to adapt the
HermiT test runner to make it work again.
task assigned to: Birte

- There is still a Java Task: "TODO: Minimazation caused some problems
in the translation of concepts. I need to first fully integrate with
HermiT and then look on this again. "
task assigned to: Giorgos 							[DONE]

- We throw UnsupportedOperation exceptions for the methods
getRanges(OWLDataProperty property), getLoadedOntologies(), and
unloadOntologies(Set<OWLOntology> inOntologies),
getDataPropertyRelationships(OWLNamedIndividual individual),
getRelatedValues(OWLNamedIndividual subject,OWLDataPropertyExpression
property). Some methods might not be implementable. In that case we
should point this out to Matthew and get rid of them, other can be
implemented and we should check how or see why we do not want to
support them.
task assigned to: Giorgos

- Blank node handling has not been tested much, so tests
have to be done and bugs should be fixed should they be found.
task assigned to: Birte

- List datatype map and supported semantics in the documentation.

Syntax optimisation to handle concepts = 257 hasDP.byte
task assigned to: Birte

- Integrate optimised classification code into the main branch
task assigned to: Rob

- Optimise the rule set/rule application so that HermiT can deal with
  SNOMED.

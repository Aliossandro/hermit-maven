- Optimise the rule set/rule application so that HermiT can deal with
  large ontologies such as SNOMED. Move existential into universial: 
  rule engine should not loop over all assignemnts for y if y does not occur 
  in the head e.g., as in r(x, y) and B(y) -> A(x)

- We need to check acyclicity of datatype definitions.
task assigned to:  Birte

- incremental classification (axioms addition/removal)

- optimise number restrictions (e.g., better clause representation)

- check what HermiT does on Robert's family ontology

- check why HermiT is so slow in expanding the tableau once we have a lot of choice points

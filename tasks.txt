- Matthew added a new version of the OWLReasoner interface to the OWL
API and we do not yet implement it (we have to talk with Matthew about 
non-implementable methods and get them removed) 
task assigned to: Giorgos

- Protege is a bit behind, but the Protege reasoner interface will
most likely also change soon to reflect the new OWLReasoner interface
changes. 
task assigned to: wait until we know more

- We need to check acyclicity of datatype definitions.
task assigned to:  Rob

- There is still a Java Task: "TODO: Minimazation caused some problems
in the translation of concepts. I need to first fully integrate with
HermiT and then look on this again. "
task assigned to: Giorgos 							[DONE]

- We throw UnsupportedOperation exceptions for the methods
getRanges(OWLDataProperty property), getLoadedOntologies(), and
unloadOntologies(Set<OWLOntology> inOntologies),
getDataPropertyRelationships(OWLNamedIndividual individual),
getRelatedValues(OWLNamedIndividual subject,OWLDataPropertyExpression
property). Some methods might not be implementable. In that case we
should point this out to Matthew and get rid of them, other can be
implemented and we should check how or see why we do not want to
support them.

- analyse and fix memory leaks
task assigned to: Birte, Boris

-Modularise  classification code and integrate Rob's classification 
task assigned to: Giorgos, Boris

- Matthew added a new version of the OWLReasoner interface to the OWL
  API and we have to implement it 
task assigned to: Birte

- We throw UnsupportedOperation exceptions for the methods
  getDataPropertyRelationships(OWLNamedIndividual individual, OWLDataProperty p). 
  needs implementation 
task assigned to: Birte

- Protege is a bit behind, but the Protege reasoner interface will
  also change to reflect the new OWLReasoner interface
task assigned to: Birte

- Optimise the rule set/rule application so that HermiT can deal with
  large ontologies such as SNOMED. Move existential into universial: 
  rule engine should not loop over all assignemnts for y if y does not occur 
  in the head e.g., as in r(x, y) and B(y) -> A(x)  
task assigned to: Giorgos, Rob

- cache Aboxes saturated up to non-determinism
task assigned to: 

- We need to check acyclicity of datatype definitions.
task assigned to:  Rob


- incremental classification (axioms addition/removal)

- optimise number rstrictions (e.g., better clause representation)

- learning heuristics for disjunctions
